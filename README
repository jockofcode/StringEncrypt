String open classed with AES-256 and RSA encryption and zipping methods for easy, secure, encryption of strings.

The string_encryption gem was started with the intention of being
compatible with the RSA and AES algorithms used in a javascript
library on http://www.pidder.com/pidcrypt .  Usage and testing
against the pidcrypt library hasn't been done yet, but is scheduled
for the future.
The intent of this library is to make encryption and decryption of a 
string as straight forward as capitalizing or reversing is.

To encrypt a string:  
    encrypted_secret = "Super Secret Text".encrypt("Super Secret Password")
To decrypt a string:
    decrypted_secret = encrypted_secret.encrypt("Super Secret Password")
